My name is Nick and I'm currently a computer science student with a
passion for coding. 

If you've been directed here from my resume, you
may be interested in my <a href="{{ '/projects' | relative_url }}">projects page</a>. Here I have
outlined all my personal projects and the open-source projects that I
have contributed to. They all have a brief description of what they
are or what I did and a link to the code.
